          <p>LIBTIRPC 0.1 FROM SUN'S TIRPCSRC 2.3 29 Aug 1994</p>

<p>This package contains SunLib's implementation of transport-independent
RPC (TI-RPC) documentation.  This library forms a piece of the base of Open Network
Computing (ONC), and is derived directly from the Solaris 2.3 source.</p>

<p>TI-RPC is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V
Transport Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface
(XTI).  TI-RPC is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported
by almost 70 vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code
(RPCSRC 4.0) remains available from several internet sites.</p>

<p>This release was a native source release, compatible for
building on Solaris 2.3. It had been ported from FreeBSD 5.2.1 to GNU/Linux 
in 2004.</p>

<p>Applications linked with this release's librpc must link with the United
States domestic version of libcrypt in order to resolve the cbc_crypt() and
ecb_crypt() functions.  These routines are used with Secure RPC however all
RPC programs that link with this release's librpc will need to link with the
domestic libcrypt.  </p>

<p>WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE: TIRPCSRC 2.3 FROM SUN</p>

<p>The previous release was TIRPCSRC 2.0.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<pre><code> This release is based on Solaris 2.3.  The previous release was
</code></pre>

<p>based on Solaris 2.0.  This release contains a siginificant number of
bug fixes and other enhancements over TIRPCSRC 2.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code> The RPC library is thread safe for all client-side interfaces
</code></pre>

<p>(clnt_create, clnt_call, etc.).  The server-side interfaces
(svc_create, svc_run, etc.) are not thread safe in this release. The
server-side interfaces will be made thread safe in the next release of
TIRPCSRC.  Please see the manual pages for details about which
interfaces are thread safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<pre><code> As part of the work to make the RPC library thread-safe, rpcgen has
</code></pre>

<p>been enhanced to generate thread-safe RPC stubs (the -M option).  Note
that this modifies the call-signature for the stub functions; the
procedure calling the RPC stub must now pass to the stub a pointer to
an allocated structure where results will be placed by the stub.  See
the rpcgen manual page and the rpcgen Programming Guide for details.</p>
