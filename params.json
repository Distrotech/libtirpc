{"name":"Libtirpc","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.infradead.org/~steved/libtirpc.git","body":"LIBTIRPC 0.1 FROM SUN'S TIRPCSRC 2.3 29 Aug 1994\r\n\r\nThis package contains SunLib's implementation of transport-independent\r\nRPC (TI-RPC) documentation.  This library forms a piece of the base of Open Network\r\nComputing (ONC), and is derived directly from the Solaris 2.3 source.\r\n\r\nTI-RPC is an enhanced version of TS-RPC that requires the UNIX System V\r\nTransport Layer Interface (TLI) or an equivalent X/Open Transport Interface\r\n(XTI).  TI-RPC is on-the-wire compatible with the TS-RPC, which is supported\r\nby almost 70 vendors on all major operating systems.  TS-RPC source code\r\n(RPCSRC 4.0) remains available from several internet sites.\r\n\r\nThis release was a native source release, compatible for\r\nbuilding on Solaris 2.3. It had been ported from FreeBSD 5.2.1 to GNU/Linux \r\nin 2004.\r\n\r\nApplications linked with this release's librpc must link with the United\r\nStates domestic version of libcrypt in order to resolve the cbc_crypt() and\r\necb_crypt() functions.  These routines are used with Secure RPC however all\r\nRPC programs that link with this release's librpc will need to link with the\r\ndomestic libcrypt.  \r\n\r\nWHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE: TIRPCSRC 2.3 FROM SUN\r\n\r\nThe previous release was TIRPCSRC 2.0.\r\n\r\n1.      This release is based on Solaris 2.3.  The previous release was\r\n\tbased on Solaris 2.0.  This release contains a siginificant number of\r\n\tbug fixes and other enhancements over TIRPCSRC 2.0.\r\n\r\n2.      The RPC library is thread safe for all client-side interfaces\r\n\t(clnt_create, clnt_call, etc.).  The server-side interfaces\r\n\t(svc_create, svc_run, etc.) are not thread safe in this release. The\r\n\tserver-side interfaces will be made thread safe in the next release of\r\n\tTIRPCSRC.  Please see the manual pages for details about which\r\n\tinterfaces are thread safe.\r\n\r\n3.      As part of the work to make the RPC library thread-safe, rpcgen has\r\n\tbeen enhanced to generate thread-safe RPC stubs (the -M option).  Note\r\n\tthat this modifies the call-signature for the stub functions; the\r\n\tprocedure calling the RPC stub must now pass to the stub a pointer to\r\n\tan allocated structure where results will be placed by the stub.  See\r\n\tthe rpcgen manual page and the rpcgen Programming Guide for details.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
